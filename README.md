# Quickstart
```
mkvirtualenv -p `which python3` systems
pip install ipython bokeh jsonschema
ipython notebook
```

Note that sometimes your shell won't notice programs installed in a
newly created virtual environment. You may have to exit
(i.e. "deactivate") and restart (i.e. "workon") it to see the proper
`ipython`.
